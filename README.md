# Stacey Template
### A base template built on [Stacey](https://github.com/kolber/stacey/)

This template uses [Stacey](https://github.com/kolber/stacey/) as the back-end, and SASS, Compass, and Grunt to help build the front-end. It's a stripped down boilerplate style template, ready to build upon quickly.

To replace the variables across files, you can use this [script](https://github.com/samisking/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/new_site.sh) by changing the path variables, and taking out the things you don't need etc.
